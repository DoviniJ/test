## <i class="fa fa-map" aria-hidden="true"></i> plinkQC

**plinkQC** is a R/CRAN package for **genotype quality control** in genetic association
studies. It makes PLINK basic statistics (e.g.missing genotyping rates
per individual, allele frequencies per genetic marker) and relationship
functions easily accessible from within R and allows for automatic evaluation
of the results.

**plinkQC** facilitates an ancestry check for study individuals based on 
comparison to reference datasets. The processing of the reference datasets is
documented in detail [here](articles/AncestryCheck.html).

**plinkQC** generates a per-individual and per-marker quality control report.
Individuals and markers that fail the quality control can subsequently be
removed with **plinkQC** to generate a new, clean dataset. A detailed,
step-by-step documentation is provided [here](articles/plinkQC.html).

Removal of individuals based on relationship status via **plinkQC** is optimised
to retain as many individuals as possible in the study.
