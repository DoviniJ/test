\usage{
check_sex(qcdir, alg, externalSex = NULL, maleTh = 0.8,
  femaleTh = 0.2, interactive = FALSE, fixMixup = FALSE,
  externalFemale = "F", externalMale = "M", externalSexSex = "Sex",

}
\arguments{
\item{qcdir}{[character] path/to/directory/with/QC/results containing
alg.sexcheck results as returned by plink --check-sex. Users needs writing
permission to qcdir.}

\item{alg}{[character] prefix of QC-ed plink files, i.e. alg.bed, alg.bim,
alg.fam and alg.sexcheck.}

\item{externalSex}{[data.frame, optional] with sample IDs [externalSexID] and
sex [externalSexSex] to double check if external and PEDSEX data (often
processed at different centers) match.}

\item{maleTh}{[double] Threshold of X-chromosomal heterozygosity rate for
males.}

\item{femaleTh}{[double] Threshold of X-chromosomal heterozygosity rate for
females.}

\item{interactive}{[logical] Should plots be shown interactively? When
choosing this option, make sure you have X-forwarding/graphical interface
available for interactive plotting. Alternatively, set interactive=FALSE and
save the returned plot object (p_sexcheck) via ggplot2::ggsave(p=p_sexcheck,
other_arguments) or pdf(outfile) print(p_sexcheck) dev.off().}

\item{fixMixup}{[logical] Should PEDSEX of individuals with mismatch between
PEDSEX and Sex, with Sex==SNPSEX automatically corrected: this will directly
change the alg.bim/.bed/.fam files!}

\item{externalFemale}{[integer/character] Identifier for 'female' in
externalSex.}

\item{externalMale}{[integer/character] Identifier for 'male' in externalSex.}

\item{externalSexSex}{[character] Column identifier for column containing sex
information in externalSex.}

\item{externalSexID}{[character] Column identifier for column containing ID
information in externalSex.}

\item{verbose}{[logical] If TRUE, progress info is printed to standard out.}

\item{path2plink}{[character] Absolute path to where external plink software
\url{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/} can be found. If not provided,
assumed that PATH set-up works and plink will be found by system("plink").
Only reqired if fixMixup=TRUE.}
}
\value{
named list with i) fail_sex: dataframe with FID, IID, PEDSEX, SNPSEX
and Sex (if externalSex was provided) of individuals failing sex check,
ii) mixup: dataframe with FID, IID, PEDSEX, SNPSEX and Sex (if externalSex
was provided) of individuals whose PEDSEX != Sex and Sex == SNPSEX and iii)
p_sexcheck, a ggplot2-object 'containing' a scatter plot of the X-chromosomal
heterozygosity (SNPSEX) of the sample split by their (PEDSEX), which can be
shown by print(p_sexcheck).
}
\description{
Evaluates and depicts results from plink --check-sex. Reads resulting file
qcdir/alg.sexcheck and returns IIDs for samples whose SNPSEX != PEDSEX (where
the SNPSEX is determined by the heterozygosity rate across X-chromosomal
variants).
Mismatching SNPSEX and PEDSEX IDs can indicate plating errors, sample-mixup
or generally samples with poor genotyping. In the latter case, these IDs are
likely to fail other QC steps as well.
Optionally, an extra data.frame (externalSex) with sample IDs and sex can be
provided to double check if external and PEDSEX data (often processed at
different centers) match. If a mismatch between PEDSEX and SNPSEX was
detected, by SNPSEX == Sex, PEDSEX of these individuals can optionally be
updated (fixMixup=TRUE).
check_sex depicts the X-chromosomal heterozygosity (SNPSEX) of the samples
split by their (PEDSEX).
